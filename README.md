**Overview**
Atliq Grands, a luxury 5-star hotel chain operating across four major Indian cities, faced revenue decline and rising competition despite its 20+ years in the industry. To address this, three months of booking data (May–July) was analyzed to uncover performance gaps, optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and improve long-term revenue growth.


**Business Problems Addressed**
How to optimize dynamic pricing for weekdays, weekends, and peak seasons?
Which properties have low revenue performance and high cancellation rates?
What booking patterns emerge by city, season, and day type?
How can revenue recovery and efficiency be improved?
Which booking platforms have the highest cancellations, and how can policies be redesigned?


**Key Findings**
Bangalore: ADR (~₹13,000) remained flat despite demand surges and dips. Occupancy dropped to ~51% mid-month but spiked to 64% at month start/end → missed revenue opportunities due to lack of dynamic pricing.

Delhi: Weekend occupancy (76.7%) far exceeded weekday occupancy (53.7%), but ADR dropped slightly on weekends → pricing failed to capture demand surge.

Mumbai: Strong positive correlation between customer ratings and occupancy. Low-rated hotels (2.3 avg) had ~44% occupancy, while high-rated hotels (4.3 avg) achieved ~66%. Revenue directly impacted by service quality and reviews.

Hyderabad: Lead time analysis revealed last-minute bookings dominated but had 25–29% cancellations. Medium lead time (3–4 days) was most reliable. Early bookings (7–20+ days) had highest cancellation risk (30–40%).

Booking Platforms: "Others" generated the highest revenue but had the highest cancellations (25.2%). Direct Online channel showed potential but suffered from high cancellations.


**Strategic Recommendations**
Dynamic Pricing:
Raise ADR during high-demand periods (start/end of month, weekends).
Introduce tactical discounts during low-demand weeks to boost occupancy.
Day-Type Strategy (Delhi & Hyderabad):
Weekend = Premium ADR strategy
Weekday = Competitive ADR + promotional offers
Quality & Ratings (Mumbai):
Upgrade facilities and improve guest experiences in low-rated hotels.
Leverage strong ratings in premium marketing campaigns.
Lead-Time Optimization (Hyderabad):
Increase ADR for last-minute bookings (0–1 days).
Offer slight discounts for medium lead time (3–4 days).


Platform Optimization:
Strengthen Direct Online channel via first-time booking discounts, loyalty programs, and reduced dependency on intermediaries.
Prioritize stable platforms like Logtrip (lower cancellations).


**Outcome**
The analysis highlights that Atliq Grands can significantly improve RevPAR, ADR, and occupancy by aligning pricing strategies with demand fluctuations, improving customer experience, leveraging ratings, and strengthening direct booking channels.
